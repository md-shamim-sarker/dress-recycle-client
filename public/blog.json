        "question": "What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?",
        "answer": "A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The isolated part of the definition is important. Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before it's deployed. This ensures a reliable engineering environment where quality is paramount. Over the course of the product development life cycle, unit testing saves time and money, and helps developers write better code, more efficiently."

        "question": "React vs. Angular vs. Vue?",
        "answer": "React is based on JavaScript, but it’s mostly combined with JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that allows you to create elements that contain HTML and JavaScript at the same time. The Vue.js core library focuses on the View layer only. It’s called a progressive framework because you can extend its functionality with official and third-party packages, such as Vue Router or Vuex, to turn it into an actual framework. AngularJS, the original framework, is an MVC (Model-View-Controller)) framework. But in Angular 2, there’s no strict association with MV*-patterns as it is also component-based."
